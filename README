== emoticon: A library for transcoding Japanese mobile phones' emoticons (emoji)

This library has been extracted and refactored from Jpmobile, a rails plugin
for handling Japanese mobile phones.  Most of the code in this library was
written for Jpmobile.  Once this library is mature, I hope to merge it back
into Jpmobile.

== Author

Once again, I did not do most of the work in creating this library.  Most of
the credit goes to Yohji Shidara (and any others) who worked on the original
Jpmobile code.
